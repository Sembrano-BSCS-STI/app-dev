## Mob Psycho 100

I started watching **Mob Psycho 100** last November. I've been seeing content about the show for months, and I even tried to watch the first episode last year but gave up on it. This time though, I was bored and curious enough to keep watching. I'm glad I did! *I found my favorite series in this comforting anime.* ðŸ˜„

My favorite thing about the show is its **characters**. I relate to them and I understand them, even if their actions or motives are selfish, self-serving, and morally grey. My favorite characters are ==Reigen Arataka and Teruki Hanazawa==. Both of them are deeply flawed characters who feel very human to me.

### Reigen Arataka
- Reigen Arataka who wanted to be someone.
- Reigen was willing to abandon a comfortable life because he wanted change. He was willing to throw himself deep in the mud, to con other people, for the sake of being that someone. 

> *Yet*, despite the clear lack of morality in fooling people, **he wanted to be someone good**. It's the lesson he taught Mob, that the most important thing is you remain intact with your humanity.

It's also his crippling impostor syndrome that made him look at himself with guilt and grief that I related to the most, but let's talk about Teruki. 

### Teruki Hanazawa
- Teruki, who was self-serving. 
- Teruki, who thought the world revolved around him because he waas different from most people. 
- Teruki, who hurt others. 
- Teruki, who had to wake up from his delusion. 

> I had a past similar to Teruki. I was violent and angry and arrogrant, and I was lonely. Teruki's isolated from people. Once, it was out of his control, but later on it was a result of his own doing. But Teruki changedâ€”although not completely. That's what I loved about his character. He changed quickly, he became a good person, but he wasn't necessarily niceâ€”not to himself, not with the way he viewed other peple still. **He was a work in progress. What mattered is how he's trying to be better.**

Seeing myself in these types of characters forced me to answer to the questions the show presented. I spent a lot of time thinking about them, turning myself over and over until I can make up an answer that speaks to me. I don't think I've arrived to that conclusion yet, but the show taught me an important lesson and that it's okay to figure things out and take the time to do so. Change, one I craved so much, is within my grasp. **I am the protagonist of my own life, and my story is far from over.**
